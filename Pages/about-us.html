                    <p>We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in Okotoks, Alberta.
                        When we’re not scouring the globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest, ripest and boldest
                        ingredients, we’re crafting perfect pizzas for you and your family to enjoy. From hot
                        Hawaiians and classic Canadians to crispy wings and decadent fudge brownies, everything at
                        Okotoks Pizza is baked with love.</p><br>

                        <p>If you think you can or you think you can't - you're right! 
                            The difference between winners and losers is a positive mental attitude.
                             Our attitude is a reflection of what we value: successful team members must be upbeat,
                            proactive and passionate about everything they do.</p><br>
                        <p>After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Doug Cleveland
                            learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time. Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza
                            in 2004, Doug has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Greek-style pizza his family
                            perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern and convenient comfort food for today’s
                            family on the go.</p>
